title: "Race and Ethnicity Lab"

In this lab, we will explore the racial and ethnic make up of six states in the US.  As always, start by loading the libraries.
 
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Load your libraries here

library('lehmansociology')
library('acs')
library('printr')

```

Similar to what we did in the internal migration lab, we'll start by creating geographies.  What this does is tell R which states we want data for.  Then we pull the data from the ACS.  Enter in the year 2015 in lines 31 and 32 where prompted to tell the ACS we want data for the year 2015.

````{r}

california <- geo.make(state = "CA")
florida <- geo.make(state = "FL")
newyork <- geo.make(state = "NY")
wyoming <- geo.make(state = "WY")
westvirginia <- geo.make(state = "WV")
kentucky <- geo.make(state = "KY")


selectedstates <- california + florida + newyork + wyoming + westvirginia + kentucky

race2015 <- acs.fetch(geography = selectedstates, table.number = "B02001", 
                      endyear = ENTER YEAR HERE, col.names = "pretty")
HispanicLatino <- acs.fetch(geography = selectedstates, table.number = "B03002",
                            endyear = ENTER YEAR HERE, col.names = "pretty")

The formatting of the variable names are a bit messy when we first pull them from the ACS, so what we're doing here is cleaning up those names.  You'll notice we've pulled two sets of data, one for race, and one for Hispanic or Latino ethnicity.  ACS gives us the data with states in the first column and the variables across the first row.  While this data is correct, the table is very wide and hard to read, so we transpose the datasets to have the variables we are interested listed down the first column and the states across the top.  At the end of this chunk of code, you'll display the transposed datasets as we have them so far.  You'll also notice when you knit to PDF, that even these transposed tables are very wide and may not fit on the page neatly.  That's ok.

````{r}

race2015.names <- acs.colnames(race2015)
new.names <- stringr::str_sub(race2015.names, start = 7)
acs.colnames(race2015) <- new.names

race <- as.data.frame(estimate(race2015))

HispanicLatino.names <- acs.colnames(HispanicLatino)
new1.names <- stringr::str_sub(HispanicLatino.names, start = 29)
acs.colnames(HispanicLatino) <- new1.names

HispanicLatino <- as.data.frame(estimate(HispanicLatino))

racetransposed <- t(race)

HispanicLatinotransposed <- t(HispanicLatino)

racetransposed

HispanicLatinotransposed

````

Since there are spaces in the variable names, we'll need to change those spaces to periods to make them easier to use in the code.  We'll also want to get rid of other odd characters like colons and commas that R has trouble with.  The code below cleans up the variables names to make them usable.

````{r}

new1.names <- str_replace_all(str_trim(new1.names), " ", ".")
new1.names <- str_replace_all(str_trim(new1.names), ":", "")
new1.names <- str_replace_all(str_trim(new1.names), ",", "")
colnames(HispanicLatino) <- new1.names

new.names <- str_replace_all(str_trim(new.names), " ", ".")
new.names <- str_replace_all(str_trim(new.names), ":", "")
new.names <- str_replace_all(str_trim(new.names), ",", "")
colnames(race) <- new.names

````

It's easier to work with one single dataset.  Here, we are taking the two variables we want from the HispanicLatino dataset and add them to the race dataset.  This way, we only need to think about one dataset.  Two two variables we are adding are Not.Hispanic.or.Latino and Hispanic.or.Latino.

````{r}

race$Not.Hispanic.or.Latino <- HispanicLatino$Not.Hispanic.or.Latino
race$Hispanic.or.Latino <- HispanicLatino$Hispanic.or.Latino

````

The ACS provides the data in counts (number of people), but it is easier to interpret percents, especially if we are comparing across states.  Below, we are calculating percentages rather than counts for the variables we are interested in using.

````{r}

race$percent_total <- round(100*race$Total/race$Total)

race$percent_White.alone <- round(100*race$White.alone/race$Total)
race$percent_Black.alone <- round(100*race$Black.or.African.American.alone/race$Total)
race$percent_American.Indian.alone <- round(100*race$American.Indian.and.Alaska.Native.alone/race$Total)
race$percent_Asian.alone <- round(100*race$Asian.alone/race$Total)
race$percent_Pacific.Islander.alone <- round(100*race$Native.Hawaiian.and.Other.Pacific.Islander.alone/race$Total)
race$percent_Some.other.race.alone <- round(100*race$Some.other.race.alone/race$Total)
race$percent_Two.or.more.races <- round(100*race$Two.or.more.races/race$Total)

race$percent_Not.Hispanic.or.Latino <- round(100*race$Not.Hispanic.or.Latino/race$Total)
race$percent_Hispanic.or.Latino <- round(100*race$Hispanic.or.Latino/race$Total)

````

Now, to separate out the new variables we created with percents, we're creating a new dataset that only includes the new variables measured in percents.  Then, since the datasets are easier to read if we flip the columns and rows, we transpose the new dataset.  The last line of code displays your completed table. I've left the dataset names for these final datasets blank.  Go ahead and enter in a name for these datasets.  You can name them anything you would like, as long as the corresponding dataset names match.

````{r}

PERCENT DATA SET NAME <- dplyr::select(race, percent_total, percent_White.alone, percent_Black.alone, percent_American.Indian.alone, percent_Asian.alone, percent_Pacific.Islander.alone, percent_Some.other.race.alone, percent_Two.or.more.races, percent_Not.Hispanic.or.Latino, percent_Hispanic.or.Latino)

TRANSPOSED DATA SET NAME <- t(PERCENT DATA SET NAME)

TRANSPOSED DATA SET NAME

````

Back in Blackboard, you'll answer questions based on this completed table.
