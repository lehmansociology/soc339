In this lab, we will explore the share of the population in race/Hispanic origin groups in the United States, using decennial census data. We will compare data from 2010 and 2020. Note that how race and Hispanic origin were asked and how responses were coded changed 2010 and 2020, so we need to interpret changes cautiously. Differences between 2010 and 2020 are due both to demographic changes, and to operational changes like adjustments to participant response options and processing of the data.

As always, we start by loading our libraries. The "tidycensus" package allows us to pull data from the Census Bureau, the "tidyverse" package allow us to manipulate the data, and the "ggplot2" package allows us to visualize the data. For this lab, since we are pulling data from the Census Bureau, you will need to enter your Census API key.
 
```{r}

library('soc339')
library('lehmansociology')
library('tidycensus')
library('tidyverse')
library('ggplot2')

census_api_key("YOUR CENSUS API KEY HERE")

```

First, we pull data from the 2020 Census. Since we will be combining some of the categories, we pull the data in "wide" format, which means each variable is its own column. This makes it easier for us to add some of the columns together to create a new column.

```{r}

Race_Ethnicity_2020 <- get_decennial(geography="us", 
                                     variables=c("P2_002N", "P2_005N", "P2_006N", "P2_007N", "P2_008N", "P2_009N", "P2_010N", "P2_011N"), 
                                     year=2020,
                                     output="wide")

Race_Ethnicity_2020$SomeOtherRace <- Race_Ethnicity_2020$P2_007N + Race_Ethnicity_2020$P2_009N + Race_Ethnicity_2020$P2_010N

Race_Ethnicity_2020 <- Race_Ethnicity_2020[ ,c(2:5, 7, 10, 11)]

names(Race_Ethnicity_2020) <- c("Geography", "Hispanic_or_Latino", "White_NH", "Black_NH", "Asian_NH", "Two_or_More_Races_NH", "Some_Other_Race_NH")

```

Note that the categories available from the census are broad categories, and in this lab we will focus on six groups - Hispanic or Latino, White (non-Hispanic), Black (non-Hispanic), Asian (non-Hispanic), Some Other Race (non-Hispanic), and Two or More Races (non-Hispanic). These are mutually exclusive groups, so no person is counted in multiple groups. This is only one way for us to utilize the data from the census on race and Hispanic origin categories. We will explore other ways these data are provided and can be organized on Blackboard.

Graphing is easier with long format data. So our next step is to change the data from wide to long. Here, in short, we take columns 2 through 7 of our data, and change them into two columns - one specifying the name of the variable, the other the value of that variable.

```{r}

Race_Ethnicity_2020_Long <- pivot_longer(Race_Ethnicity_2020, 2:7, names_to="Group", values_to="value")

```

Go ahead and view the wide and long format versions of these data. They contain the same information, but organized differently. To view the datasets enter the names of our two datasets in the chunks below. If you can't remember the names of the datasets, look at the syntax above or look within the environment window.

```{r}

NAME OF WIDE DATASET

```

```{r}

NAME OF LONG DATASET

```

For this lab, we are interested in the percent of the population within each group. So, we'll calculate a percentage, which is the number of people in each group divided by the total population, times 100. We then want to include variable specifying the year the data refer to, which is 2020.

```{r}

Race_Ethnicity_2020_Long$Percent <- Race_Ethnicity_2020_Long$value/331449281*100

Race_Ethnicity_2020_Long$Year <- 2020

```

Let's try graphic these data. We'll start with a 100% bar graph. This will give us a bar split with sections showing the percent of the population in each group.

```{r}

Race_Ethnicity_2020_Plot <- ggplot(Race_Ethnicity_2020_Long,  aes(x="", y=Percent, fill=Group)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", position="stack") +
  scale_fill_brewer(type="qual", palette=1) +
    geom_text(aes(label=round(Percent, 1)), position=position_stack(vjust=0.5), check_overlap=T) +
  labs(title="Percent of Population by Race/Hispanic Origin Group, United States, 2020", fill="Race/Hispanic Origin Group") +
  theme_void()

Race_Ethnicity_2020_Plot

```

Notice that there is the "_" symbol instead of spaces in the names of the groups. The "_" is a holdover from when the groups were the names of their own columns in the wide format data, since there cannot be spaces in variable names in R. We'll remove the "_" symbols and replace them with spaces.

Also notice that the order of the variables in alphabetical. This is the default for categorical variables in R. If we'd like to provide our own order, we can do wo with the "factor()" command. Let's provide an order for the data.

Fill in a number for the color palette for the graph. You have a choice to select any number between 1 and 8. Try a color palette, see what you think, then try another by changing out the number and running the syntax again. Run the lines of syntax below, and note the differences in the graph here versus the graph from the previous chunk of syntax.

```{r}

Race_Ethnicity_2020_Long$Group <- gsub("\\_", " ", Race_Ethnicity_2020_Long$Group)

Race_Ethnicity_2020_Long$Group <- factor(Race_Ethnicity_2020_Long$Group, levels=c("Hispanic or Latino", "White NH", "Black NH", "Asian NH", "Some Other Race NH", "Two or More Races NH"))


Race_Ethnicity_2020_Plot <- ggplot(Race_Ethnicity_2020_Long,  aes(x="", y=Percent, fill=Group)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", position="stack") +
  scale_fill_brewer(type="qual", palette=ENTER COLOR PALETTE NUMBER) +
    geom_text(aes(label=round(Percent, 1)), position=position_stack(vjust=0.5), check_overlap=T) +
  labs(title="Percent of Population by Race/Hispanic Origin Group, United States, 2020", fill="Race/Hispanic Origin Group") +
  theme_void()

Race_Ethnicity_2020_Plot

```

Another improvement we can make is to create a pie chart, rather than a 100% bar. The "coord_polar()" command will allow us to do this. This command takes the bar from the bar graph, and wraps it into a circle.

```{r}

Race_Ethnicity_2020_Plot <- ggplot(Race_Ethnicity_2020_Long,  aes(x="", y=Percent, fill=Group)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", position="stack") +
  scale_fill_brewer(type="qual", palette=1) +
    geom_text(aes(label=round(Percent, 1)), position=position_stack(vjust=0.5), check_overlap=T) +
  labs(title="Percent of Population by Race/Hispanic Origin Group, United States, 2020", fill="Race/Hispanic Origin Group") +
  coord_polar("y", start=0) +
  theme_void()

Race_Ethnicity_2020_Plot

```

Now that we've produced our visualization of 2020 data, let's add in 2010 data. The lines below import and process the data in much the same way that we did for the 2020 data. The last line in this chunk combined our 2020 and 2010 data into a single data set so that we can graph data from both time points together.

Enter the year 2010 in the "get_decennial()" command to specify we want to pull 2010 Census data. Further below, enter syntax to calculate the percentages using the "value" variable and the total population of the United States in 2010, which was 308,745,538. Remember not to use commas when entering the total population.

```{r}

Race_Ethnicity_2010 <- get_decennial(geography="us", 
                                     variables=c("P005010", "P005003", "P005004", "P005005", "P005006", "P005007", "P005008", "P005009"), 
                                     year=ENTER YEAR HERE,
                                     output="wide")

Race_Ethnicity_2010$SomeOtherRace <- Race_Ethnicity_2010$P005005 + Race_Ethnicity_2010$P005007 + Race_Ethnicity_2010$P005008

Race_Ethnicity_2010 <- Race_Ethnicity_2010[ ,c(2:5, 7, 10, 11)]

names(Race_Ethnicity_2010) <- c("Geography", "Hispanic_or_Latino", "White_NH", "Black_NH", "Asian_NH", "Two_or_More_Races_NH", "Some_Other_Race_NH")

Race_Ethnicity_2010_Long <- pivot_longer(Race_Ethnicity_2010, 2:7, names_to="Group", values_to="value")

Race_Ethnicity_2010_Long$Percent <- CALCULATE PERCENT HERE

Race_Ethnicity_2010_Long$Year <- 2010

Race_Ethnicity_2010_Long$Group <- gsub("\\_", " ", Race_Ethnicity_2010_Long$Group)

Race_Ethnicity_2010_Long$Group <- factor(Race_Ethnicity_2010_Long$Group, levels=c("Hispanic or Latino", "White NH", "Black NH", "Asian NH", "Some Other Race NH", "Two or More Races NH"))

Race_Ethnicity <- rbind(Race_Ethnicity_2020_Long, Race_Ethnicity_2010_Long)

```

The main difference in the syntax below and the syntax for our visualization of the 2020 data is the inclusion of the "facet_wrap()" command, which allows us to produce multiple parallel graphics separated by a particular variable. In this case, we are separating by year. The syntax below will produce two pie charts - one for 2010, and one for 2020. This allows us to view data from the two time points side by side. 

Enter in our Y variable and the fill variable. Look at the syntax from previous chunks as an example. The Y and fill variables are the same as they were before. Also, go ahead a pick a color palette here again as you did before..

```{r}

Race_Ethnicity_10_and_20_Plot <- ggplot(Race_Ethnicity,  aes(x="", y=ENTER Y VARIABLE, fill=ENTER FILL VARIABLE)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", position="stack") +
  scale_fill_brewer(type="qual", palette=ENTER COLOR PALETTE NUMBER) +
  geom_text(aes(label=round(Percent, 1)), position=position_stack(vjust=0.5), check_overlap=T) +
  facet_wrap(~Year, strip.position="bottom") +
  labs(title="Percent of Population by Race/Hispanic Origin Group, United States, 2010 and 2020", fill="Race/Hispanic Origin Group") +
  coord_polar("y", start=0) +
  theme_void() +
  theme(strip.text=element_text(size=11))

Race_Ethnicity_10_and_20_Plot

```
