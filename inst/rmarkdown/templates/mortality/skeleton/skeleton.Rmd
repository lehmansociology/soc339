In this lab we will calculate death rates per year in the US from 1933 to 2019. As always, we'll start by loading the necessary libraries. The "HMDHFDplus" library allows us to pull data from the Human Mortality Database and the Human Fertility Database. The "dplyr" package allows us to manipulate the data. And, the "ggplot2" package allows us to visualize the data.
 
```{r}

library('soc339')
library('lehmansociology')
library('HMDHFDplus')
library('ggplot2')
library('dplyr')

```

Just like when we calculated birth rates, let's start with pulling the annual population from mortality.org. When we pull it, it provides population information by age. When we format the data using the "aggregate" function, what we are doing is combining the population at each age within a year to get a single population count for all ages in a given year.

````{r}

population <- readHMDweb(CNTRY='USA', item='Population', 
                         username='YOUR MORTALITY.ORG USERNAME', 
                         password='YOUR MORTALITY.ORG PASSWORD')
total_pop_by_year <- aggregate(x=population[4:9], by=list(Year=population$Year), FUN=sum)
total_pop_by_year <- dplyr::select(total_pop_by_year, Year, Total1)
total_pop_by_year <- dplyr::rename(total_pop_by_year, Population=Total1)

````

Now let's pull the data on number of deaths in the US. As with the population data, this information comes broken down by year and ages. To get a single death rate per year, we'll need to aggregate the deaths at all ages in a given year to get a single number of deaths per year.

````{r}

mortalitycount <- readHMDweb(CNTRY='USA', item='Deaths_1x1', 
                             username='YOUR MORTALITY.ORG USERNAME', 
                             password='YOUR MORTALITY.ORG PASSWORD')
mortality_by_year <- aggregate(x=mortalitycount[3:5], by=list(Year=mortalitycount$Year), FUN=sum)
mortality_by_year <- dplyr::select(mortality_by_year, Year, Total)
mortality_by_year <- dplyr::rename(mortality_by_year, Deaths=Total)

````

Right now we have two different datasets, each with one of the pieces of information we need. We have the dataset total_pop_by_year with annual population data, and we have mortality_by_year with annual death counts. To put these together into a single dataset that we'll call mortalitydata, we'll use the merge function.

````{r}

mortalitydata <- merge(total_pop_by_year, mortality_by_year, by='Year')

````

Now go ahead and calculate the mortality rate on your own. Remember, to name a particular variable, you'll need to specify the dataset, use the $ sign, then specify the variable.  For example, if we want to create a new variable called "deaths_population" in the "mortalitydata" dataset, we'll need to call it mortalitydata$deaths_population for R to understand where both what to call this variable, and where to save it.

````{r}

#calculate deaths divided by population here

mortalitydata$deaths_population <- YOUR CALCULATION HERE

#calculate (deaths/population)*1000 here

mortalitydata$mortalityrate <- YOUR CALCULATION HERE
  
````

Now, we'll plot the annual mortality rates. You'll need to fill in the death rate variable with the name you gave for the variable above.

````{r}

MortalityRatePlot <- ggplot(mortalitydata, aes(x=Year, y=DEATH RATE VARIABLE HERE)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  labs(x="Year", y="Crude Death Rate", title="US Death Rate 1933-2019") +
  theme_bw()

MortalityRatePlot

````

While we can see that the mortality rate is declining, this hides a lot of variation in mortality rates at specific ages. To look at this in a little more detail, we'll calculate the Age Specific Mortality Rate.

````{r}

ASMRdata <- dplyr::select(population, Year, Age, Total1, Total2)
ASMRdata$Mortalitycount <- mortalitycount$Total

````

Now that we have a dataset with both population by age and number of deaths by age, we can calculate an age specific mortality rate.

````{r}

ASMRdata$mortality_population <- ASMRdata$Mortalitycount/ASMRdata$Total1
ASMRdata$ASMR <- ASMRdata$mortality_population*1000

````

Now let's graph the age specific mortality rate. For this graph, we want to plot age on the X axis, and the age specific mortality rate on the Y axis. Fill in the X and Y variables in the plot syntax below. If you need to check the names of the variables, look back in the previous chunks of this lab to review the syntax we used to create the variables, or use the command View(ASMRdata) to view the dataset and the available variables within it.

In the "labs()" command with the plot syntax, the labels for the x and y axes, as well as the title for the plot are set. Fill in the prompts to label the x and y axes, and give the plot a title that fits the contents of the graph.

````{r}

ASMRPlot <- ggplot(data = ASMRdata, aes(x = X VARIABLE HERE, y = Y VARIBLE HERE, color=Year)) + 
  geom_line(aes(group=Year)) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0,110,10)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,1000,100)) +
  labs(x="LABEL FOR X VARIABLE", y="LABEL FOR Y VARIABLE", title="TITLE OF GRAPH") +
  theme_bw()
