In this lab, we will look at net international migration. Net international migration is the balance of people moving into and moving out of the United States from all other countries. To explore this, we will use data from the US Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program. Each year, the Population Estimates Program released population estimates and components of change for various levels of geography. To produce these estimates, they use the Population Balancing Equation, which is

Target Population = Base Population + Births - Deaths + Net Domestic Migration + Net International Migration

Births, deaths, net domestics and net international migration are each components of change.

As always, we will start by loading our libraries. The "tidycensus" package will allow us to pull data from the Census Bureau, the "tidyr" package lets us manipulate the data, and the "ggplot2" and "scales" package will help us produce graphics.

For this lab, you will need to enter your Census API Key.

```{r}

library('soc339')
library('lehmansociology')
library('tidycensus')
library('tidyr')
library('ggplot2')
library('scales')

census_api_key("YOUR CENSUS API KEY HERE")

```

Each year, the Census Bureau released a new "vintage" with estimates back to the previous census year. The vintage refers to the last year of the estimate. So, for example, Vintage 2015 included estimates for the years from 2010 to 2015. Vintage 2016 included estimates for the years from 2010 to 2016. We'll start by pulling in the data for the United States released in Vintage 2019. 

```{r}

IntlEst2019 <- get_estimates(geography="us", 
                             variables="INTERNATIONALMIG",
                             year=2019,
                             time_series=T)

```

Let's plot the net international migration estimates for the United States, starting with 2010-2011 and ending with 2018-2019.

```{r}

IntlMigPlot <- ggplot(IntlEst2019, aes(x=PERIOD, y=value)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0,1200000), labels=comma) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(2,10), breaks=seq(2,10,1), labels=c("Jul 1, 2010 - Jun 30, 2011", "Jul 1, 2011 - Jun 30, 2012","Jul 1, 2012 - Jun 30, 2013","Jul 1, 2013 - Jun 30, 2014","Jul 1, 2014 - Jun 30, 2015","Jul 1, 2015 - Jun 30, 2016","Jul 1, 2016 - Jun 30, 2017","Jul 1, 2017 - Jun 30, 2018","Jul 1, 2018 - Jun 30, 2019")) +
  labs(title="International Migration, US July 2010 - Jun 2019", x="Time Period", y="Migration Estimate") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=45, vjust=1, hjust=1))

```

With the release of each vintage, the Population Estimates Program re-estimates all previous years in the release. This allows the Population Estimates Program to release updated estimates for previous years based on new information and based on adjustments to their methods. Let's pull the international migration data for 2018, 2017, 2016, and 2015. Then, we will combine these different vintages into one dataset for us to graph.

Here, enter the year for the vintage we would like for each data pull, and enter T for the time_series option. The time_series option gives us data not just for the end year, but for all previous years in the series back to the previous census. You can look at the data pull for vintage 2019 earlier in this lab, and look at the name of the data set each creates (e.g. "IntlEst2015") for which year goes in which spot.

```{r}

IntlEst2015 <- get_estimates(geography="us", 
                             variables="INTERNATIONALMIG",
                             year=ENTER YEAR HERE,
                             time_series=ENTER T or F HERE)

IntlEst2016 <- get_estimates(geography="us", 
                             variables="INTERNATIONALMIG",
                             year=ENTER YEAR HERE,
                             time_series=ENTER T or F HERE)

IntlEst2017 <- get_estimates(geography="us", 
                             variables="INTERNATIONALMIG",
                             year=ENTER YEAR HERE,
                             time_series=ENTER T or F HERE)

IntlEst2018 <- get_estimates(geography="us", 
                             variables="INTERNATIONALMIG",
                             year=ENTER YEAR HERE,
                             time_series=ENTER T or F HERE)


IntlEst2019$vintage <- "Vintage 2019"
IntlEst2018$vintage <- "Vintage 2018"
IntlEst2017$vintage <- "Vintage 2017"
IntlEst2016$vintage <- "Vintage 2016"
IntlEst2015$vintage <- "Vintage 2015"


IntlEstimates <- IntlEst2019 %>%
  rbind(IntlEst2018) %>%
  rbind(IntlEst2017) %>%
  rbind(IntlEst2016) %>%
  rbind(IntlEst2015)

```

Now let's graph international migration estimates for each of the vintages. Within the geom_line() command, there is an argument for the color of the line, which is set by the vintage. This will produce a separate line for each vintage, with each line being a different color.

The "scale_y_continuous()" command allows us to set up our y-axis for the graph. We want a scale for the y-axis that goes high enough to view all of the data. We also want breaks on the scale (that is the where the horizontal lines and axis labels that help with interpretation go on the graph) that are easy to understand and interpret. Let's put a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 1,200,000. These go in the "limits" option. For breaks, let's put a line every 200,000 between 0 and 1,200,000. Fill in the prompts below with this information to set parameters for the y scale. Remember not to use commas in numbers within R commands.

```{r}

IntlMigPlotVintages <- ggplot(data=IntlEstimates) +
  geom_line(aes(x=PERIOD, y=value, color=vintage)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(ENTER MINIMUM HERE, ENTER MAXIMUM HERE), breaks=seq(ENTER MINIMUM HERE, ENTER MAXIMUM HERE, ENTER DISTANCE BETWEEN MARKERS HERE), labels=comma) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(2,10), breaks=seq(2,10,1), labels=c("Jul 1, 2010 - Jun 30, 2011", "Jul 1, 2011 - Jun 30, 2012","Jul 1, 2012 - Jun 30, 2013","Jul 1, 2013 - Jun 30, 2014","Jul 1, 2014 - Jun 30, 2015","Jul 1, 2015 - Jun 30, 2016","Jul 1, 2016 - Jun 30, 2017","Jul 1, 2017 - Jun 30, 2018","Jul 1, 2018 - Jun 30, 2019")) +
  labs(title="International Migration, US, Estimates Vintages 2015-2019", x="Time Period", y="Migration Estimate", color="Vintage") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=45, vjust=1, hjust=1))

IntlMigPlotVintages

```
As you can see, the estimates vary quite a bit from one vintage to the next, including revisions to estimates from earlier vintages.
