In this lab, we will look at net domestic migration. Net domestic migration is the balance of people moving into and moving out of a place from elsewhere in the United States. To explore this, we will use data from the US Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program. Each year, the Population Estimates Program released population estimates and components of change for various levels of geography. To produce these estimates, they use the Population Balancing Equation, which is

Target Population = Base Population + Births - Deaths + Net Domestic Migration + Net International Migration

Births, deaths, net domestics and net international migration are each components of change.

As always, we will start by loading our libraries. The "tidycensus" package will allow us to pull data from the Census Bureau, the "tidyverse" package lets us manipulate the data, the "ggplot2" and "scales" package will help us produce graphics, and the "tigris" package will allow those graphics to be map-based.

```{r}

library('soc339')
library('lehmansociology')
library('tidycensus')
library('tidyverse')
library('ggplot2')
library('scales')
library('tigris')
options(tigris_use_cache=T)

census_api_key("ENTER YOUR CENSUS API KEY HERE")

```

Let's access data for net domestic migration from 2018 to 2019 for each state. We will save these data in a data set called DomesticMig.

```{r}

ENTER DATA SET NAME HERE <- get_estimates(geography="state",
                             variable="DOMESTICMIG",
                             year=2019,
                             geometry=T) %>%
  shift_geometry()

```

Now we'll map the data. Here we are using a map version of ggplot. You can see the commands are very similar to producing graphs, as we have done in previous labs. Instead of "geom_line()" or "geom_bar()", as we use in other laps, we use "geom_sf()" here to make a map within "ggplot()".

```{r}

StateMap <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data=DomesticMig, aes(fill=value), color="grey60") +
  coord_sf(crs=5070, datum=NA) +
  scale_fill_gradient2(low="#8e1600", mid="#FFFFFF", high="#003d80", midpoint=0, labels=comma) +
  labs(title="Domestic Migration by State,\nUnited States, July 1, 2018 - June 30, 2019", fill="Domestic Migration") +
  theme_void() +
  theme(plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5))

StateMap

```

Another geography available to us is the county level. To get a better sense of what's happening within New York State, let's pull data on New York counties. In the "geography" option, enter "county". Each state has an assigned number, called a FIPS code. New York's is 36. Enter this FIPS code for the "state" option.

```{r}

DomesticMigCountyNY <- get_estimates(geography="ENTER GEOGRAPHY HERE",
                             variable="DOMESTICMIG",
                             year=2019,
                             state=ENTER STATE FIPS CODE HERE,
                             geometry=T)

```

And let's map the county data. Enter the data set name for the data on New York counties that we've just pulled into R to complete this "ggplot()" command.

```{r}

CountyMap <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data=ENTER NY STATE COUNTIES DATA SET NAME HERE, aes(fill=value), color="grey60") +
  coord_sf(datum=NA) +
  scale_fill_gradient2(low="#8e1600", mid="#FFFFFF", high="#003d80", midpoint=0, labels=comma) +
  labs(title="Domestic Migration by County,\nNew York State, July 1, 2018 - June 30, 2019", fill="Domestic Migration") +
  theme_void() +
  theme(plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5))

CountyMap

```

Note that domestic migration at the county level looks a little different than domestic migration at the state level. But also note that what it means is different. When we look at states, it's the balance of people moving to and from other states. When we look at counties, it's the balance of people moving to and from other counties, even if those counties are within the same state. So, for example, someone moving from Nassau county on Long Island to Queens is captured in the county map above, but is not captured in the state map.

Now let's look at whether the patterns for county-level domestic migration in New York State have changed. We'll pull data for each year from 2010-2011 through 2018-2019. It would be difficult to view all the years side by side, so we'll map just 2010-2011, 2014-2015, and 2018-2019 to get a sense of whether patterns differ from earlier in the decade to later in the decade. To view all three, we'll use a command called "facet_wrap()" in our "ggplot()", which produces multiple versions of a graphic side by side. This will tell "ggplot()" to produce different graphics for different years. Enter a name for the plot. Note that the name needs be to entered twice. The first time is with the "ggplot()" command to the left of the "<-", establishing the name the plot is saved under. The second is the name written by itself to indicate you would like to view the plot, just like when you enter the name of a data set to view that data set.

```{r}

DomesticMigCountyNYYears <- get_estimates(geography="county",
                             variable="DOMESTICMIG",
                             year=2019,
                             state=36,
                             time_series=T,
                             geometry=T)

DomesticMigCountyNYYears <- DomesticMigCountyNYYears[which(DomesticMigCountyNYYears$PERIOD==2|DomesticMigCountyNYYears$PERIOD==6|DomesticMigCountyNYYears$PERIOD==10),]

DomesticMigCountyNYYears$Year <- 0
DomesticMigCountyNYYears$Year[which(DomesticMigCountyNYYears$PERIOD==2)] <- "Jul 1, 2010 - Jun 30, 2011"
DomesticMigCountyNYYears$Year[which(DomesticMigCountyNYYears$PERIOD==6)] <- "Jul 1, 2014 - Jun 30, 2015"
DomesticMigCountyNYYears$Year[which(DomesticMigCountyNYYears$PERIOD==10)] <- "Jul 1, 2018 - Jun 30, 2019"

ENTER NAME FOR PLOT HERE <- ggplot(data=DomesticMigCountyNYYears) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill=value), color="grey60") +
  coord_sf(datum=NA) +
  facet_wrap(~Year, ncol=2) +
  scale_fill_gradient2(low="#8e1600", mid="#FFFFFF", high="#003d80", midpoint=0, labels=comma) +
  labs(title="Domestic Migration by County,\nNew York State", fill="Domestic Migration") +
  theme_void() +
  theme(plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5))

ENTER NAME FOR PLOT HERE
