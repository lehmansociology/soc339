In this lab we will look at Population Pyramids. Population Pyramids are a type of diagram that show the number of individuals at each age in a population, split by sex. These diagrams allow us to visualize if a population is growing, stable, or shrinking. They also allows us to see the relative number of individuals at a given age, compared to other ages. As always, let's start by loading our libraries. The "HMDHFDplus" package allows us to pull data from the Human Fertility Database and the Human Mortality Database. The "tidyr" package allows us to manipulate the data. And, the "ggplot2" and "scales" packages allow us to create graphics.
 
```{r}

library('soc339')
library('lehmansociology')
library('HMDHFDplus')
library('tidyr')
library('ggplot2')
library('scales')

```

We'll use data from mortality.org for this lab. First, let's get the population data for the US. Enter in your username and password below.

```{r}

population_USA <- readHMDweb(CNTRY = 'USA', item = 'Population', 
                             username = 'YOUR MORTALITY.ORG USERNAME HERE', 
                             password = 'YOUR MORTALITY.ORG PASSWORD HERE')

population_USA <- population_USA[,c(1,2,4,5)]
names(population_USA) <- c("Year", "Age", "Female", "Male")

population_USA_long <- pivot_longer(population_USA, cols=c("Female", "Male"), names_to="Gender", values_to="Population")

```

Let's start by visualizing the population pyramid for the United States in 1940. You'll notice within the "ggplot()" command, we use "subset()". The "subset" command allows us to pick only certain rows from the data. Here, we want to only pick the rows that correspond to the year 1940. Go ahead an run the completed example below. There is no need to alter anything in this example.

```{r}

PopPyramid1940_USA <- ggplot(subset(population_USA_long, Year %in% "1940")) +
  geom_bar(aes(x=Age, fill=Gender, y=ifelse(Gender=="Male", -Population, Population)), 
           stat="identity") +
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(-2500000,2500000), breaks=seq(-2500000,2500000,500000), 
                     labels=c("2.5M","2.0M","1.5M","1.0M","0.5M","0","0.5M","1.0M","1.5M","2.0","2.5M")) +
  labs(title="Population Pyramid, United States, 1940", y="Population", x="Age", fill="Sex") +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_bw()

PopPyramid1940_USA

```

We'll create a population pyramid for every 10 years up to 2010. In the syntax below, we first select only years ending in "0," so that we have data for 1940, 1950, 1960, and so on through 2010. Then, in the "ggplot()" command, we use "facet_wrap()" to display a separate population pyramid for each decade. In the "ggplot()" command, fill in the data set name. Here we're using population_USA_long_decade. Also fill in the X and fill variables, which match from the example for 1940 above. The fill variable determines the color of the bars displayed.

```{r}

population_USA_long_decade <- population_USA_long[which(population_USA_long$Year=="1940"|population_USA_long$Year=="1950"|population_USA_long$Year=="1960"|population_USA_long$Year=="1970"|population_USA_long$Year=="1980"|population_USA_long$Year=="1990"|population_USA_long$Year=="2000"|population_USA_long$Year=="2010"),]

PopPyramids_USA <- ggplot(data=ENTER THE DATA SET NAME HERE) +
  geom_bar(aes(x=ENTER THE X VARIABLE HERE, fill=ENTER THE FILL VARIABLE HERE, y=ifelse(Gender=="Male", -Population, Population)), 
           stat="identity") +
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(-2500000,2500000), breaks=seq(-2500000,2500000,500000), 
                     labels=c("2.5M","2.0M","1.5M","1.0M","0.5M","0","0.5M","1.0M","1.5M","2.0","2.5M")) +
  labs(title="Population Pyramids, United States, 1940-2010", y="Population", x="Age", fill="Sex") +
  facet_wrap(~Year, ncol=4) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90, hjust=1, vjust=1))

PopPyramids_USA

```

Now let's do the same for Japan. Fill in your mortality.org username and password to get Japan's population data. The syntax below first pulls in the data for Japan, then selects only the years ending in "0."

```{r}

population_JPN <- readHMDweb(CNTRY = 'JPN', item = 'Population', 
                             username = 'YOUR MORTALITY.ORG USERNAME HERE', 
                             password = 'YOUR MORTALITY.ORG PASSWORD HERE')

population_JPN <- population_JPN[,c(1,2,4,5)]
names(population_JPN) <- c("Year", "Age", "Female", "Male")

population_JPN_long <- pivot_longer(population_JPN, cols=c("Female", "Male"), names_to="Gender", values_to="Population")

population_JPN_long_decade <- population_JPN_long[which(population_JPN_long$Year=="1950"|population_JPN_long$Year=="1960"|population_JPN_long$Year=="1970"|population_JPN_long$Year=="1980"|population_JPN_long$Year=="1990"|population_JPN_long$Year=="2000"|population_JPN_long$Year=="2010"),]

```

Now let's create population pyramids from the data for Japan to match the population pyramids we made for the United States. Using the above examples as guidelines, fill in the data set name (population_JPN_long_decade), the X and fill variables. Also fill in the title, X, and Y labels in the "labs()" command. These pyramids mirror what we did above for the US, but for Japan from 1950-2010.

```{r}

PopPyramids_JPN <- ggplot(data=ENTER DATA SET NAME HERE) +
  geom_bar(aes(x=ENTER X VARIABLE HERE, fill=ENTER FILL VARIABLE HERE, y=ifelse(Gender=="Male", -Population, Population)), 
           stat="identity") +
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(-1500000,1500000), breaks=seq(-1500000,1500000,500000), 
                     labels=c("1.5M","1.0M","0.5M","0","0.5M","1.0M","1.5M")) +
  labs(title="ENTER DIAGRAM TITLE HERE", y="ENTER Y AXIS LABEL HERE", x="ENTER X AXIS LABEL HERE") +
  facet_wrap(~Year, ncol=4) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90, hjust=1, vjust=1))

PopPyramids_JPN

```

Go ahead and knit to PDF.  Back in Blackboard we will analyze these population pyramids.
