```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Load your libraries here

library('lehmansociology')

```

Get data from mortality.org
Make sure to add your own password and email inside the quotation marks
````{r getdata}
#type your code here
library(HMDHFDplus)
dataset <- readHMDweb(CNTRY = 'USA', item = 'Population', 
                         username ='email', 
                            password = 'password')
````

Now you create the population pyramid by using the populationPyramid(df, year, entityname) function.
df is the name of your data (probably dataset unless you changed it)
Year is the year you will create the pyramid for.
Entity name will be used in the title of the graph. THis neeed to be in quotation marks.

```{r createpyramid}

populationPyramid(dataset, 1980, "United States")
```
